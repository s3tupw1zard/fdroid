### How to use

1. At first, you should [install the F-Droid app](https://f-droid.org/), it's an alternative app store for Android.

2. Now you can copy the following link: [s3tupw1zard's F-Droid Repo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3tupw1zard/fdroid/main/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=30C8B33215CDFDA5C78BCB3D1B7E4B0F8F050697820D7BE320E29D61A72ECC60), then add this repository to your F-Droid client:
   
   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/s3tupw1zard/fdroid/main/fdroid/repo?fingerprint=30C8B33215CDFDA5C78BCB3D1B7E4B0F8F050697820D7BE320E29D61A72ECC60]
   ```
   
    Alternatively, you can also scan the QR code:
   
   <p align="center">
      <img src=".github/qrcode.png?raw=true" alt="F-Droid repo QR code"/>
    </p>

3. Open the link in F-Droid. It will ask you to add the repository. Everything should already be filled in correctly, so just press "OK".

4. You can now install my apps, e.g. start by searching for your app in the F-Droid client.

Please note that some apps published here might contain [Anti-Features](https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Anti-Features/). If you can't find an app by searching for it, you can go to settings and enable "Include anti-feature apps".

### For developers

If you are a developer and want to publish your own apps right from GitHub Actions as an F-Droid repo, you can generate a repository from this template and see [the documentation](/docs/setup.md) for more information on how to set it up.
