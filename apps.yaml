    Grocy Android is an open-source Android client for grocy (source code). Grocy is a self-hosted groceries & household management solution for your home.
    Grocy Android uses grocy's official API to provide you a beautiful interface on your phone with powerful barcode scanning and intuitive batch processing, all what you need to efficiently manage your groceries.
    This app requires a running self-hosted instance of the grocy server application. It is a companion app, therefore it cannot run standalone or manage products itself! You can try and test all features using the demo option available on the login screen.
